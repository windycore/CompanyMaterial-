@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value found in some of the sequential elements. Applying an initial value to a register may not produce optimum synthesis results. For example, registers with initial values may become preserved which would prevent retiming/pipelining from being performed. To improve synthesis results, remove register initialization from the RTL code.
